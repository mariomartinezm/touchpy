Touchpy provides an easy way to configure the following settings using `libinput`:

  * Cursor speed.
  * Tap to click.
  * Disable touchpad while typing.

You can also configure Touchpy's color scheme by editing its configuracion file located at  `~/.config/touchpy/config.ini`.

**Note**: Touchpy can only configure devices managed through libinput, i.e., it cannot configure devices that use the Synaptics drivers.
